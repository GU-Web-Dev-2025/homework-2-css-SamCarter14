            Built a lead-tracking web application with React, Node.js, and IIS,
            allowing Member Advocates to filter members by criteria such as
            expiring accounts and balances, integrated with a SQL database for
            real-time read/write access. Developed interactive Python scripts
            using scikit-learn to perform custom data analysis on CSV files,
            allowing users to select columns and run models including decision
            trees, random forests, linear regression, and logistic regression.

            Developed a monitoring website using Apache, Python and Bash scripts
            to collect and display power consumption data from over 170 racks
            and 350 PDUs, with graphical displays for individual racks, cages,
            datacenter locations, and total racks. Utilized PostgreSQL database
            in a Docker container to store data, with a PostgreSQL client in
            another Docker container for data writing, scheduled with a cron job
            every 5 minutes. Employed Apache, htmx and Bash scripts for power
            cycling nodes, enhancing operational efficiency across 3
            datacenters. Automated the process of adding new machines and racks
            with Bash scripts, facilitating future scalability.

            Servers using rotational topology, as well as configuring 2 switches
            for each rack with IP Routing and default gateways. Developed a Bash
            script to automate the process of measuring the maximum power
            consumption for 90 servers across our racks and another to
            concurrently control 40 PDUs for efficient power management.
