          <!--Summary paragraph-->
          I have lived in the Pacific Northwest my whole life, and have pretty
          much have always known I wanted to be a Zag, so here we are. My love
          for computer science first began back in high school when I took my
          first one-semester CS class called "Intro to Game Development". My
          first ever project was actually a tank shooter game that I worked on
          with some friends. I instantly became captivated by the world of CS,
          falling in love with the idea of creating applications for others to
          use. Welcome to my personal website!

                Built a lead-tracking web application with React, Node.js, and
                IIS, allowing Member Advocates to filter members by criteria
                such as expiring accounts and balances, integrated with a SQL
                database for real-time read/write access. Developed interactive
                Python scripts using scikit-learn to perform custom data
                analysis on CSV files, allowing users to select columns and run
                models including decision trees, random forests, linear
                regression, and logistic regression.

                Developed a monitoring website using Apache, Python and Bash
                scripts to collect and display power consumption data from over
                170 racks and 350 PDUs, with graphical displays for individual
                racks, cages, datacenter locations, and total racks. Utilized
                PostgreSQL database in a Docker container to store data, with a
                PostgreSQL client in another Docker container for data writing,
                scheduled with a cron job every 5 minutes. Employed Apache, htmx
                and Bash scripts for power cycling nodes, enhancing operational
                efficiency across 3 datacenters. Automated the process of adding
                new machines and racks with Bash scripts, facilitating future
                scalability.

                Servers using rotational topology, as well as configuring 2
                switches for each rack with IP Routing and default gateways.
                Developed a Bash script to automate the process of measuring the
                maximum power consumption for 90 servers across our racks and
                another to concurrently control 40 PDUs for efficient power
                management.
